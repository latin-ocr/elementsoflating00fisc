108 SYNTAX.

They rnay generally be distinguished from the interrogatives by the antecedente, ex-
pressed or understood, to which relatives regularly must refer, whereas interrogatives
have no antecedents, as : IN'rmenoGA'nvn ε leo has done titis? (ὶ. e. Which. person has
done this 5³). RELA'rivn z lee person 11111 0 has done this.

3⁷5. The antecedent of a relative is a noun, pronoun, absolute ad-

jective, etc., to which the relative refers, and in place of which it is used.

O m 11 i a q ‘aaa tibi ητιννᾱυὶς Everything (all) which I have told you.

Ta,l qbzy‘i) (ζῖ)ιεί εὶῗίεέέιςκέὶηιε consilio (110 ornas& Yon, who have benefited me most fre-
quent y ⁷ · -1 .

376. Relative adjectives agree with their antecede-ms in gender and
number ; the case is deterinined according to the relation which the rel-
ative has in its own clause. It always takes the same case which the

antecedent would take if used in place of the relative.

Audivistis smmnos homines qui (cute me αἰαῖέναηί ; Yon have heard the greatest
men (orzitors) who have spoken bel'ore mess [The relative qui is the subject in its clause,
and hence requires the nominative. Its antecedent hommes, with which it agrees in
number and gender, stands in the accusative]

Multae c α n s α e Gaesarem ad id consilium adclamarent, q 11 a 7· u m haec fyr-arissz'mafni&

was compelled to restore all the cities ot· the AEtolians which he had seized. [Here the

Rem. 199. Frequently relative clauses take absolute demonstrativos (ἓ 87; §304 foll.)
as antecedente, lfor which purpose generally is, ea, icc is used, referring to persons or
thiliors in genera ε

Rem. 201. Whole sentences may be antecedents of a relative, which, in this instance,
is placed in the neuter singular, as : Glaucia homofuz't insanissimus, quod inter omnes
con-stcct‚· Glaucia was¹ the most insane inan, which is known to all.

Rem. 202. Frequently relatives are used with the soree of demonstr-atim or personal pro-
nouns, opening a new period. as ε Romnum Tiberim trans-iit. Q 11 e m postquam ad urbem
accedere Vejentes audivere, ebriam esst-essi sunm Romulus crossed the Tiber. When the
Vejentians heard that 11 c was approachiug their city, they went out to meet him.

377. Indefinite relatives are those that correspond to English relatives
in connection with ever or soez·e1=(wlmezrer‚ achiel-asamar, ete). They have gen-
erally the meaning every one {demand hence may be used without any ante-
cedent. Latin indefinite relatives are formed by doubling the relative (but

in the interrogative form), or by suffixing cunque to the ordinary relatives, as:

Quisquis or quicunque. whoever. whichsoever ς quidquid or quodcunque, whatsoever3
quotquot or quotcunque, how many soever ; quantuscunque, how great (much) soever.
