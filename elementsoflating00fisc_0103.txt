330. The English present perfect must be expressed by the Latin
present, if au action which has been lasting for some time is represented
as still continuing. Osten, in this instance, the adverbjam (now, already)

is added in Latin, without being rendered in English.

In hocjudiciojam biennium vers ᾶ mum In this trial we h a v e b e e n (now, already)
e ῗῙΞνῗιξίἓιῗ είὲἐιεΐέἶ ἴξᾶἷὶῖὶεφάε tuas,· 1 h a v e b e e n e X p e c ti n g f or a long time a let-

· ter of yours.

331. The present tense is often used in place of a perfect (ἓ 332) in

stating the facts of a narrative. This is called historical present.

Lssaesar concilium dimittit, Liscum retinet ,⁰ Caesar dismissed the council, but retained
iscus.

CHAPTER SECON D.

PERFECT AND PLUPERFECT TENSES

332. The Latin perfect comprises both the English preterite (past

tense) and the English present-perfect in most of their uses.

333. The Latin pluperfect generally corresponds to the English plu-

perfect tense.

tthrtes item suas copim in 8 t r u ω e r a nt ,⁰ The enemy h a d likewise d r aw n u p
,q
ῗὲἑέῗὲἱόηεε, quae prooeime c on ε c ν z' p t a e e r a n t, totum clamen claudEbanQ The two

a rr i v ed from the Tusculan villa, when your letter was lianded to me.

Rem. 178. The pluperfect of the passive voice and os deponents sometimes takes the
auxiliarysueram instead of eram, chiefly to denote actions which happened before other
actions, remote from the time spoken of, as: Caeear Tasqetio membrum locum restzcu-
erat, quod in omnibus bellis simulari ejus operti fu e 7· at u ε u s ‚· Caesar b a d r e s t o r ed
ῑο Tasgetius the position of his ames-tots, because in all the wars h e n a d u sed his
eminent service. ’

For the use of the auxiliaryfui (instead os sum) with perfect passive and deponente,
see the larger grammar.
