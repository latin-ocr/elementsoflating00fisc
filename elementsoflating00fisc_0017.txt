2S. The Cases of noune and other declinable words denote their dif-
ferent relations to other words of a sentence. There are six cases in
Latin for both singular and plural: NOMINATIVE, GENITIVE, DATIVE,
ACCUSATIVE, VOCATIVE, and ABLATIVE. These are distinguished by
their endings‚ as NOM. mensa, a table; GEN. mensae, of a table. The
cases, except nominative and vocative, are called oblique cases.

29. What remains of a word after taking off the ending, is called
the stem. Thus mens 15 the stem of mensa, aster taking off the nomi-
native ending α.

30. There are five deolensions in Latin, which are chiefly distin-
guished by the endings of the genitive singular. The first declension
has the genitive ending ae ,· the second, z· ,· the third, is ,· the fourth, a&

the fifth, ei.
31. There are no articles in Latin. The noun yloria may mean 9Zory,

or the ylory, or a ylow‘y.

Rem. 13. All neuters have three cases alike in each number, namely, the nominative,
accusative, and vocative. Their ending in the plural 15 always ἄ.
Rem. 14. In the plural the dative is always like the ablative.

Rem. 15. The vocative 15 always like the nominative, except of nouns of the second

declension in us (ἓ 36).
