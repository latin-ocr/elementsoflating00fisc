II. DEPENDENT SUBJUNCTIVE.

353. The subjunctive used in dependent clauses is called dependent
subjunctive. It mostly corresponds to the English 1ND10AT1VE3 more
rarely to the English potential, and very seldom to the English sub-
junctive.

354. Dependent clauses (or clauses without any addition) are those
sentences, by which other sentences (principal or governing sentences)
are qualified. They are generally introduced by peculiar connectives,
which are either relative adjectives and adverbs (wlco, ‘tollere etc), or
subordinating conjunctions (that, because, tf, when ete). See B. VI.—
Sentences not dependent in this sense, are called independent sentences.

Rem. 193. If a dependent clause is interrogative, it has no subordinating connective,
