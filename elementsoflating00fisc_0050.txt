44 ETYMOLOGY.

132. In all compound tenses the participle is placed in the masculine,
feminine, or neuter gender, according to the gender of the subject
(ξ 171), as: Urbe eoepayneta est, the city was taken 3 PLUR: Urbes ea:-
puyncitae sunt, the cities were taken. ’

133. The verbal adjective in [cras adds this termination to the stem
of the supine, after taking off its ending um, as : Monere —monitz‘w’us;
leyere — lectz'w’us ,· audire — auditam&

Rem. 72. Of this rule there are a few exceptione, as ε mori, to die 3 perf, partic. mor-
tuus (g 140), verba] adj. ε mor—icarus.

134. The following five verbs occur only in the perfect system, with·
out having a present system, being called perfect (or preterite) verbs=

 

Coepi. I ὸέῃανη SUP. coeptum. odi, I hate ; Sur. wanting.
memini, I remember ,¹ SUP. wanting. consuevi, Iam (lectt-stomed ; SUP. consuetum.
novi„ I know ,· SUP.'notum.

Rem.73. These verbs form all the active tenses of the perfect system (plup. coeperam ‚· ,
memineram, noveram. oderam, consueveram, ete). Memini forms also an imperative of -
the second form (memento, remember). Coepi is also used in the passive voice with pas· ’,
{iv{5n·fi¹¹iti1ve⁵' but with active meaning : Urbs oppzcymiri coepta est ‚· The city began to

e esieget .

Ι

Rem. 74. Of these perfect verbs only coepi has the meaning of an English past tense. ἔ
The other verbs have in their perfecte t'ne meaning os an English present, in their ως-
perfects the meaning of an English past tense, aud in their future-perfecte the mea ·
ing of an English future-present, as: Memineram, Ι remembered3 odero, I shall hate3
novissem, I would know, ete. c ·,

135. Verbs which form their perfects with the termination vi fre-

quently are contracted by omitting the syllables vi or ve, when these ζ,

syllables are followed by s or 7².

Amavisti — amasti 3 amavisse - amasse. Audivisti - audisti 3 audivisse ·- audisse.
Novisti —- nosti 3 novissem — nossem. Amaverim — amarim 3 amaverunt — amarunt.
Consueverunt — consuerunt 3 consueverint - consuerint 3 noverim — norim 3 noverunt
-— norunt.

Rem. 75. When the syllable ve is preceded byi (chiefly iu the fourth conjugation)‚
only the letter v is elided, as : audiverim — audierim; petiverint -petz‘erint.

Rem. 76. In verbs with the characteristic ῐ, the letter v may hc omitted, even when vi ·
is noc followed hy s or φ’, as : peliri — pem. This is almost always the case in the com· ¹
pounds of ire, to go. as: Abire. to go away3 perf. abii (instead of abivi). Redire, to re-
turn3 perf. redii (instead of redivi).

  

VI. DEPONENT VERBS.

136. Deponent verbs are passives without an active voice. Almost Ξ
all of them (except nasei, to be born) have an active sissnfflcation. ’ὅ
137. Deponents are conjugated like Passiveg. Hence they have only ’
three principal forms ε the present infinitive‚ the present indicative, and Z
the supine. Instead of the supine generally their full perfect indicatives
arc given, as ε
Hortari, to exhort ,- hortor 3 hortatus sum.

138. Deponents, besides the forms of the passive voice, have several '‘ss
forms of the active voice, some with active, some with passive meaning: ᾖ
