Rem. 107. Many verbs construed with a double object in the accusa· ¹
tive and dative, take different constructions in English. Here belong:

1. Verbs of ιΤΑΚΙΝΘ AWAY, as demere, adimere, eripere, and other sim-
ilar verbs. In Latin the person from whom something is taken, is placed
in the DATIVE. This dative must be considered as a dative of the inter-
ested person to whose disadvantaqe the action is performed (ἓ 235); as:

Senatus silvam Moesiam Vej e n t i b u s ademit ‚· The senate took from the Vejen-
tians the Maesian forest.

in command over something ’' :

ὼῧᾶἔξιξξῖιοὶοέ {trt n i s Labienum praeposuit· Caesar placed Labienus in command 0 v e r
e wm er quar ers. '

3. Bellum inferre alicui ,· to make war on somebody—Gratias alicui
ayere, to thank somebody—Fidem alicui habere, to place confidence in
somebody—Diem alicui dicere, to summon somebody before a court (lit-
erally: “ To say or appoint a day to somebody ”).—Salutem alicui dicere,
to greet somebody ; to give somebody one’s compliments.—Praedam
militibus distribuere, to distribute the booty among the soldiers. There
are a great many similar consti-actions which must be learned by practice.

239. Several verbs may take, besides the dative of the “interested
person’' an abstract predicate-dative (ἓ 221) denoting the purpose sor
which the action is performed. Such datives are variously rendered (for,
to, as).
