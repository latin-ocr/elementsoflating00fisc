CHAPTER FIRST.

OBJECTS IN GENERAL.

223. Words dependent on verbs or adjectives are called objecta, and..
the phrases formed by objects with their governing words are called Ὗ
objective phrases. Latin objects are generally placed before their gov- i

erning words.

Discordiam odisse ; To hate discord. Here odisse, to hate, is the governing verb of ·

the object discordiam. i
Belli cupidus ,· Desirous of war. Here belli is the object of the governing adjective

cupidus.
224. If a verb or adjective requires the addition of an object, and will' ἶ
not make complete sense without it, the object is called “completing

object.”
Bellum ,σω-θνα 'ro wagc a war. The verb qerere, to wege, does not make complete, t
sense without its object : hence bellum is a completing object os yerere. >

Rem. 102. A verb or adj‹›ctive is said to be ⁸· construat ‘' with its comuleting object, off· ⁴.
with the case oi· othei· iorni in which the object must be placed. Thus we say that<
qerere is cenarum with an accusative.

225. Objects which describe the place, time, or modality of their govcg ⁴
erning verbs οι· adJ'ectives are called “ adverbial objects.” “’

Urbem ri camere,- To take the city by force. Here vrbem is a completing object οἷ’
capere which makes no complete sense by itself. But “vis'' which describes the modalitx] ’
of the taking. is an adverbial object of capere. “ Urbem capere” will make complete ⁴

sense without vi.
