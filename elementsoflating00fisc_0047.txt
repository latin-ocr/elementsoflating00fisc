12⁷. Inceptive (inchoative) verbs are derived verbs of the third con-
jugation‚ representing the action of their primitive verb (adjective, or
noun) as incipient or growing. They are formed by inserting the conso-
nants sc between stem and ending. Such verbs generally take the per-
fect-s and supines of their primitive verbs.

arescere (arere), to become dms, aresco arui —-——
concupiscere (cupere), lo coz-et, concupisco concupivi concupitum
crescere (cernere), to qrow, cresco crevi cretum
ingemiscere (gemere), to qroan, ingemisco ingemui ——
obstupescere (stupere), to he amaad, obstupesco obstupui ———-
reviviscere (vivere), to revtve, revivisco revixi revictum
Rem. 69. Of several inceptives the primitives are obsolete, as z
consuescere, to aecus-tom, consuesco consuevi consuetum
ignoscere, toparcion, ignosco ignovi ignotum
pascere, tofeed, pasco pavi ’ pastum
quiescere, to rest, quiesco quievi quietum

ff Those inceptives which are derived from adjectives or nouus, generally take ui
without a supine, as ε consenescere (to become old), perf. consenui ,· obmutescere (to
grow dumb), perf. obmutui.

128. Compound verbS‚ i. e. those which are composed of a simple
verb with a prefix (generally a preposition, see ξ 155), mostly follow
their simple verbs in the formation of their perfects and supines, as:

desinere, to eease (sinere), desino desivi desitum

commovere, lo meite (movere), commoveo commovi commotum
eligere, to select (legere), eligo elegi electum.
inhibere to inbibit (habere), inhibeo inhibui inhibitum

Rem. 70. There are many exceptions to this rule, especially in those compounds which
change their stem—vowels (R. 82), as z

interficere. lo lem (fecere), interficio interfeci interfectum
diripere. to plaudet· wipere), diripio diripui direptum
diligere, to lz'lce (legere). diligo dilexi dilectum
