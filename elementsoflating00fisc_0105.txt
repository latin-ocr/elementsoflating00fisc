CHAPTER FOURTH.

THE TWO FUTURE TENSES.

3:37. The future-present generally corresponds to the English future
tense, both with ‘⁴ shall '' and “ will.” It is used 1) of predicted actions;

2) of intended actions,

Vos vincetis, illi ament ‚· You will vanqnish3 those yonder will fiee.

Solem praejacu &rum multitudine non videbitis.. .In umbra· iqitfurpuqnabimus. ‘⁴ You
will not see the sun for the mass of missiles”. ..“ We shall then fight in the shade.'’

ῼοὲῖιξίαν equidem, sed victus non peribo ‚· 1 shall be killed3 but Ι will not perish a van-
quis e man.

338. The future-perfect is generally used of those future actions
which must be completed before another future action can happen. They
are either rendered by an English future-perfect, or by an English future

present, sometimes by a present, or presentperfect.

when I shall have received (or '⁸ have received ”·) your letter.

Ψιὲῗιίιὲῃαῖοσὶ derit, mutandum est consilium tuum ; If this will (should) happen, your
