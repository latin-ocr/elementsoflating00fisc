PREDIOATION ΛΝΒ moons.

CHAPTER FIRST.

PREDICATION.

339. Predioation is that property of the predicate by which the sen-
tence is represented as either declarative, or interrogative, or imperative.
The predication is represented by the mood of the predicate, which ex-
presses those conceptions of the speaker that either constitute or modify
the predication (for instance possibility, wish, contingency‚ reality and
non-reality).

340. There are three moods: The Indieative, the Subjunotive‚ and
the Imperative. The imperative mood is only used in imperative sen-

tences, while the other two moods are used in any of the three classes of
sentences.

341. Interrogative sentences are those by which a question is asked.
They contain either absolute questions, when the predicate is questioned,

or relative questions, when other parts of the sentence are in question.
Rem. 179. After absolute questions the answer “ Yes ” or ‘⁶ No '' is expected.

342. Absolute questions are generally introduced by interrogative
particles, which remain untranslated in English. They are 1) num ,⁴
2) the suffix ηέ, which is added to the first important word of the sen-

tence ; 3) sometimes an. For the particles used in disjunctive questions,
see R. 196.

Rem. 180. Num is generally used when the answer ‘⁴ No '' is expected, as: Num corni-
bus caremus auc pinnis? Do we miss horus or feathers ἲ

Rem. 181. Ne is used when the answer is doubtful, as : Concedit-ne manere animos post
mortem ,ἕ Do you concede that the souls remain aster death ?

Rem. 182. In negative questions, when the answer “ Yes '’ is expected, m is affixed to

the particle von, nonne being translated by ‘⁸ not,'' as : Nonne philosophi multis z'n rebus
dissentiant? Do not philosophers disagree in many things ?

Rem. 183. The answer “Yes '' is expresses] by several affirmative particles, as etiam,
ila, sane, vero, omnino, or by a repetition os the predicate (generally with vero), as: Inte!-
lissisne qnid sentiam? Intellzqo vero (or Sam, Omnino etc). Do you understand what I
mean? Yes, [do. '

Rem. 184. The answer “ No '' is expressed by reon, minime, or by non with a repetition
of the predicate, as : Num hoc profire potes? Non possum (or Minime, Minime vero).
Can you prove this? I cannot.

Rem. 185. Sometimes the interrogative particles are omitted, as : Non (instead of nonne)
vides scopulum its-tum ,ἒ Do you not see that rock 2> - spondes? Do you promise ἲ

343. After ‘num the indefinite form-adj ectives some and any are gener·
ally expressed by qui, quae, quod, or quis, qua, quid (not by aliquis, or quis-
