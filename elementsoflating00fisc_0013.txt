LETTERS, sYLLABLEs AND SOUNDS.

l. The Latin Ianguage has the same letters as the English, except w.
The letter 16 is rarely used. It occurs instead of 6, as initial before. a
and ae, as Kalendae, instead of Calendae. The consonants y and z occur
only in words taken froin the Greek.

2. The vowels are α, 6, z', 0, u. They are either long or short.

3. Long and short vowels have the same sounds, and are distinguished
only by the longer or shorter time the speaker dwells on them.

a is pronounced. ‚like English a in father.
6 “ “ ai in hail.
i and y are pronounced“ “ 66 111 trae.
0 is pronounced. ,like English 0 in bone.
u “ “ 00 111 8002.

The short vowels a and 0 have no exact equivalents in English. Short
6 is pronouneed like English 6 111 6716ἰ,· short i, like i in pin, and short u
like u in full.

4. There are three diphthongs in general use, ae, 06, au Ae and 06
have a sound similar to English ai in bail; au is pronounced like English
ow in now.

Remark 1. Other diphthongs rarely used, are eu, ei, and uz, which are pronouneed by
passing rapidly over the vowel· sounds of which they consist.

Rem. 2. The combinations ae, oe and au are not always diphthongs. In such instances
the vowels contained in them must be separately pronouneed. which is often malked
by a diaeresis, as aar, air (pronounce ah· air); 6067 ceo Ι restrain.
