10. Vowels are long, short, 01· common (i. 0., either long or short). .

Rem. 4. Whether a vowel is long or short, is taught in Latin Prosody (see Latin School
§Gssnienica3·)‚ or in those parts of grammar which treat of inflection (see for inst. ξ 32, ξ 36,

b Βξὲἒ. gi. '111¹he length of a vowel is marked by the sign - placed over it, and its shortness
y g Ψ ·

11. A syllable is long by nature if it has a long vowel or a diphthong,
as the penults in amare, cautus.

12. A syllable is long by position if its short vowel is followed by two
or more consonants, as the penults in ferre, mayister.

Rem. 6. Two consonants leave the previous syllable short, if the former of them is a
' mute and the latter a liquid (ᾖ 5), as the penults in arbitro, tenebrae, quadruplam.

13. Accent is the pitch of the voice by which one syllable of a word
is so distinguished that it becomes the most prominent of the syllables
of the word.

Rem. 7. An aceented syllable must not be confounded with a [0779 syllable. Long syl-
lables may be without an accent, while short syllables may be acoemeti, as lasqzmt.

14. The accent is determined by the following rules ε

1. Monosyllabics have their accent on this one syllable, except prepo-
sitions and conj unctions.

2. Words of two syllables have their accent on the penult, as ε Ρῖίτεφ
d'mccs. ’

3. In words of three and more syllables the accent is on the penult, if
long, as mayi‘ster‚ doce‘re. If the penult is short, the accent is always
011 the antepenult, as ιῗὸἐέο, αφ”ϋῖ109’, ῑὲ’9ἔ7’0.

Rem. 8. For the beginner it is more essentia] to aecem the words correctly than it is
to distinguish between the long and short sounds of the vowels.

Rem. 9. Since the accent (lepends on the quantity of the penult, we have. in this
grammar, marked 1110 lengtlr ol* the penults in all wordsot three and 1nore syllablelsgly

CHAPTER SECOND.
PARTs OF SPEECH.

15. There are eight parts of speech in Latin : 1) Nouns 01· substan-
tives; 2) Pronouns; 3) Adjectives; 4) Verbs; 5) Adverbs; 6) Prepesi-
tions ; 7) Conjunctions ; 8) Interjections.

Rem. 10. Of these the first four are infiected, i. e.‚ varied by certain endings.

Rem. 11. The inflection of nouus, p1·onouns‚and adjectives is called declensi0n; that
of the verbs is called conjugation. The comparison of adjectives‚ by which their degree»
are expressed, is likcwise considered as a mode os inflection.
