211. The passive agent (ἓ 166) dependent on periphrastic gerundials is
generally placed in the DATIVE, rarely in the ablative after ab.

212. It is often better to translate gerundials with datives of the pas-
sive agent, by English active verbs, so that the agent is made the subject. ,

213. Gerunds, and not gerundives‚ must be used when the verb re—
quires its object in the dative (also genitive and ablative), the same as in
ordinary impersonal passives (ξ 237). Such gerunds are generally rendered
pasgively, the Latin dative (ablative, etc.) being turned into an English
subject.

‘⁶ must.'' In the imperfect, perfect, and future, various circumlocutions

The perfect may frequently be rendered by “ ought to harvest

being generally rendered by “should be ’' or “ ought to be.”
