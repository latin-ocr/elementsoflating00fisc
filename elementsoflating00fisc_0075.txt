COMPLETING OBJECTS.

I. OBJECT-AGCUSATIVE.

227. Most verbs which, in English, have their completing objects in
the objective case, take in Latin their objects in the accusative.

Caesar milites cohortatus est ‚· Caesar exhorted his soldiers.

Expnmmon.—The student. should learn to distinguish objects and subject& both in
Latin and in English. In English the object is aimost always placed after the verb, while
the subject generally precedes. In the two phrases “The boy see8‚'' and “He sees the boy‚''

¹ the position of the words distinctly shows that in the first, the noun ‘⁶ boy'¹ is the subject,
’ while in the second phrase it. is the objectos ‘⁴ sees.'' When these phrases are rendered

into Latin, the position of the words in both phrases may be eoeaotly tlte same: 'Phe boy
sees, puer videt (or videtpuer) ‚· He sees the boy, puerum videt (or videt puerum). By

¹ what, then, do we see that puer is the svbject in the first phrase, and the object in the
ι second? Solely by the fact thatin the first phrase it is in the nominative, and in the

e second in the accusative.

228. Verbs which require their completing objects to be in the accu-

3 sative, are called transitive verbs, and their objeets are called transitive
: objects. Transitive verbs are either active, or deponente, as laudare, to

follow

229. Every predicate, consisting of an active transitive verb, may,
without affecting the sense, be turned into a passive predicate so that the

: object-accusative of the active verb becomes a passive subject-nomina-

a

tive, while the active subject-nominative is changed into the passive

,³ agent (5167).

Acrnm cons'rnnc'rrow Rem civis opprimam The king oppresses the citizens.
PAsswn consrssuc'moxo: Cives a reqe oppm'muntum The citizens are oppressed by the

230. The verbs docere, to teach ; celare, to conceal ; poscere and flayi-

.' tare, to demand3 orare, rogare, and interroyczre, to ask, are construed
³ with a double object, each of which is placed in the accusative.
