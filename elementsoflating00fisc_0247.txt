with decided disapproval¹ 1 17-19 02 nt os the
laws governing the languagc, mr. Koby merely produces the passages from
which these laws might be constructed, without attempting to construet
them himself. His collection os examples is by no means complete, and

hence he sails to illustrate many important facts os the language.

An examination of Dr. Fischer's work will show that none of these

faults can be imputed to him. For Rules universally acknowledged only¹

the most necessary vouchers are given. But for such points as are not
generally acknowledged, and for those which, hitherto, have escaped the
attention of Glanimarians, he has introduced a complete array of testimony.
VVhenever he undertakes to refute the errors of other Grammarians, his

arguments cannot fail to carry conviction. Roby’s errors would have been

refuted by Dr. Fischer but sor the fact that Fischer's Grammar was already ’. ⁴.

stereotyped when Roby's Second Part appeared.

We invite special attention to Dr. Fischer’s treatment of Latin

Composition.

Part 1 is strictly pedagogic. The author’s aim is to introduce the
student to the system, and to acquaint him with the general ancl more

important principles of the language.

Part 11 discusses the details of Syntax, and is believed to be admirably

adapted to the wants of advanced College Classes.
