V. FORMATION OF THE TENSES AND MOODS OF THE PERFECT SYSTEM.

130. The whole finite active voice of the perfect system, and the
perfect infinitive‚ in all the four conjugations, are formed upon the per-
fect indicative by taking off its final τ’, and adding :

1) for the plnperfect indicative, &ram ;

2) for the future-perfect, &ro ,¹

3) for the perfect subjunctive, &rim ,⁶

4) for the pluperfect subjunctive, issem ,⁶

5) for the perfect infinitive, isse.

The personalendings are the same as in the present system (g 121),
except in perfect indicative (See the paradigni ἓ 129).

131. The whole (finite) passive voice of the perfect system, including
the perfect infinitive, consists of compound tenses, formed by the pres-
ent, imperfect, and future present of the auxiliary verb esse, to be
(see ξ 145), and the perfect participle of the main verb. The perfect par-
ticiple is formed by changing final m of the supine into 3.

Rem. 71. Sometimes the perfect, pluperfect. and future perfect of the auxiliary esee
(see ς 145) are used to form tho same tenses of the passive voice, as z amatu-5 fui (inst.
or eum), Ι was lovcd ς amalw- sueram (inst. of eram). 1 had bccn loved, etc.

{The Verba! Adjective in ᾶναε belongs by its meaning to the present-system ; by its
denvation to the perfect-system.
