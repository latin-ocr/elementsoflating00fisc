PARTIOIPLES. 93

elension cannot be used in this form, as: Nihil memorabile, nothing remarkable (not
‘⁶ nihil memorabilis ”).

313. Partitive genitives (in the plural) referring to number, are used
with indefinite or definite numerals as governing words, and are generally
translated literally (by “ of ”) into English. The first and second persons
of the personal pronouns in the plural, as partitive attributes, always
take the form in um (g 57 ; R. 38).

Multi ebrum, many of them-Plurimi nostrum, many of u=;.-Plertque militum, very
many (most) of the effidima—Quorum uterque, both os whom.

Rem. 173. Partitive attributes dependent on definite numerals are more generally
placedin the ablative after ea: or de, as : Unuseae (or de) comitibus reyes, one of the king’s
companions.-Tres ex militibus, three of the soldier-s.

Rem. 1⁷4. Superlatives likewise take partitive attributes in the genitive, as: Omnium
Graecorum sapientissimus, the- wisest of all Greeks.

CHAPTER THIRD.

PARTICIPIAL AND GERUNDIAL CONSTRUCTIONS.
1. PARTICIPLES.

314. Latin participles are frequently rendered by English clauses in-
troduced by relatives (wlco or which), or by conj unctions (when, while, after,
because, etc). Such participles are virtually predicate& and may take any

kind of objects, the same as predicates proper (ᾖ 223 foll.).

Romani hostium c op i a s ‚ in locum iniquum p ν ot ra c t a s ‚ memmi caede oppresserunt ;
The Romans destroyed with great slaughter the troops os the enemy, who had been drawn
into an unsavorahle place.

Ca e ε α r . militen c ο h 0 7· t ᾶ t u s . proelium commisi& caesar. aster he had exhorted
the soldiers (or Ιιαυὶηρ eaelzorted tlte soldiers), commenced the battle.

Ha η η ib ali , in fines Liqurum ve η ie η t i , duo quaestores Romcint tractuntum Two
Roman quaestors were delivered to Hannibal, when he came to the territory of the Li-
gnrians.

Arcesilas Z e n ὅ ni obtrectabat, nihil novi r ep e r i e η t i; Arcesilas den ounced Zeno,
because he did not discover anything new (i. e. for want of originality).

315. Frequently participles are used absolutely (ἓ 304 foll), or so that

they include a personal pronoun referring to a previous noun. They
must generally be resolved into clauses :

Facile erat vincere non venustante& It was easy to defeat those that did not resist
(persons not resistinz), or ‘⁶ to defeat them since they did not resist.''

¹(sigillet-{cae veniunt contra dicentium ; Crowds are coming of those that gainsay (this as-
ΒΘ On .

Urbi intranti nuntiatum est, classem esse profectam ; When he entered the city. it was

announced to him that the fleet had departed (more literally: “To him, entering the
city, it was announced,'' etc).

316. Often attributive passive participles, especially after preposi-
tions, are rendered by an English participial noun in inq, or by corre-

sponding verbal nouns :

Ante Romam conditam, before the building of Rome (literaliy “before Rome built'').
Post rempublicam constitatam, aster the constitution os the republic.
