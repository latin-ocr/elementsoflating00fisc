PREFAOE.

THE best elementary instruction in Latin is that which enables the
student to read and understand‘the classica] authors in the shortest pos-
sible time. This the author had constantly in view in preparing this
work, which teaches Latin Grammar, and Latin Reading at the same
time. It consists of a Grammar and of a Reader, containing a connected
Roman history up to the battle of Zama. ,

1. The Grammar contains only those rules indispensable to a genelal
knowledge of the language. While all the linguistic details of both
etymology and syntax are kept out, all the great and prominent features
of the Latin language are placed before the student. The rules are brief
enough to be easily memorized, plain enough to be easily understood,
and so thorough as to impress a true image of the language on the mind

Nof the student. In the grammatica] terms no essentia] and unnecessary
’ deviation is made from the expressions rendered familiar by long usage.

Sometimes new terms had to be introduced, in accordance with many
new features in our grammatical system. Those who object to these,
should remember that all grammatical terms serve to condense tliouqlit.
2. The Reader is strictly adapted to the different sections of the Gram-
mar. Ic is intended io be commenced toyeilicr with ilie yrcimmar, so that
the Grammar should be studied in ilicet order ‘which is indicated over tlte
chapters of ilie leander. Every chapter of the Reader contains a heading
referring to a section of the Grammar, which must be studied and re·-
cited before the chapter is read. The student is enabled to translate
every chapter of the Reader by the Vocabularies. In the first Vocabu-
lary‚ which belongs to the first book of the Reader (comprising the
whole of Etymology)‚ every case of nouns and adjectives, and every form
of the verb, is literally ¹rendered as far as the student, at the given place,
has not yet studied such forms. At the same time, all the passages con-
taining peculiar constructions are literally translated at the proper place

‚ in the vocabulary. Thus, for instance, in reading the first chapter, the

Γ

Student will find every word literally translated in the Vocabulary‚ and
in the same form as it occurs in the Reader, except only the nouns of the
first- declension, which have Just been studied in the grammar. Hence
there is nothing left for the student but to give to the words the arrange·

Q.. ment required in English. The nouns of the first declension, occurring

in this chapter, are given in the nominative only, as in ordinary vocabu-
