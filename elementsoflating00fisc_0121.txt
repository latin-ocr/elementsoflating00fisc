Rem. 218. The English any. asteris, is expressed by the indefinite adjective qvis (ξ 87,
3), not by aliquis or quisquam (si qais. if any: si quid, if anything. eto). ·· If at any
time '' is expressuri by si quaudo ,· ‘⁵ if anywhere''‚ by sicubi,· '⁴ if from any place '', by
sicunde ,· ‘⁶ ir to any place '‘, by si quo. See p. 80, foot-note.

398. If the condition is represented as contrary to fact, or as impossi-
ble, both the principal sentence and the clause have their predicates in
the subjunctive, which is generally in the imperfect or pluperfect. Such

constructions are called hypothetical periods.

VI. COMPARATIVE CLAUSES.

399. comparative clauses are either introduced by relative adjectives
and adverbs, or by comparative conjunctions. Comparative clauses fre-
quently appear in an abbreviated form, so that their predicate, and
sometimes other terms of the clause, must be supplied from the princi-
pal sentence (see the examples to R. 219 and {g 403. 405).

¹ 400. The relative adiectives used for the purpose of comparison, are

qui, quot, quantus, qualis, which are generally preceded by certain demon-

stratives, being, in this connection always translated by “ (18.''

Rem. 219. Qui as comparative adjective is only used in connection with a preceding idem
(idem qvi, the same as). Quot refers to a preceding tot or totidem (tot quot, as many as:
totidem quot, just, as many as). Quantus refers to tantus (tantus. „quanlusg as much as,
as great as). Qualis refers to talis (tali‚e...q71<zlzs, such as). These comparative relatives
follow in regard to their agreement the general rules on relatives (ἓ 376).

401. The relative adverbs used for comparison are quoties (referring

to confess), as often as ; and quam (after tam), SO.. ,as‚ so (as) much.. . aS.

is Quoties dicimus, toties de nobisjudicdcur; As often as we speak, (so often) judgment
