laries. In the same way the second chapter is treated in regard to the
nouns of the second declension, and so on, till at the end of the first book
the whole etymology is exhausted.

In the second book of the Reader, the syntax is similarly treated.
The heading of every chapter contains those syntactical rules which are
to be studied and recited before the reading of the chapter, and the
chapter itself contains a sufficient drill for these rules. Every construc-
tion with which the student is not familiar at a given place, is literally
rendered in the som-notes, 01· at a proper place of the second Vocabulary,
which, besides this, contains all the words occurring in the second book
of the Reader, in the same form as they usually stand in the lexicons.
At the end of the second book all the syntactical rules are thus exhausted,
and the last Chapters contain a general revieW‚ with references to the
different sections of the grammar in the foot-notes.

This method will combine several important advantages. It will in-
terest the student far more than a merely theoretical study of grammar.
His preparation for each chapter will be far more profitable, since he is
compelled to master the rules thoroughly in order to find their applica-
tion in all the passages of his chapter. The rules wil] present them—
selves in a very different liylct when viewed from the stand-point of a.
connected narrative. All the previous rules will be constantly and
practically rem'ewed, and the student will easily recognize former rules
when they are again applied in ⁴the following chapters. And last, but
not least, the student will gain a good knowledge of Roman history,
without devoting any special time to this study.

The Reader is Written in the very plainest style. But still, we hope,
no sentence will be found which an ancient Latin author would have
hesitated to write. The necessity of adapting each chapter to given
rules as they follow iu the system, caused some difficulties, which we
think have been overcome without any prej udice to the style.

The questions at the end of the book will prove an acceptable addi-
tion.‘ They will serve to draw the student's attention to all the im-
portant parts of the Grammar, and often to present the rules in a pecu-
liar light, not generally noticed in studying Latin Grammar. They will
be useful for both oral and written reviews. The answers will form in
themselves a eompact grammar in a nutshell.

The Index added to the Grannnar is complete.
