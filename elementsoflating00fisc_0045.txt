FORMATION OF THE PERFEGT svs'rEM. 39

added to the stem. The passive imperative has the same form as the
active infinitive present. The plural has the same form as the 2. pers.
present indicative. The second form of the imperative adds to, and in
the plural nto (in the 3. and 4. conjugations unio) to the stem. In the

passive o· is added to these forms.

Rem. 68. The imperative of the following verbs of the 3. conjugation, esse (see ἓ 145),
ἂῗεέιὲὲάέῑεᾶῗαζιῗέφςε ferre (see ς 147), is formed by the mere stem, without adding e

122, a. The non-finite verb in the present system is thus formed :

1) The Present infinitive passive in the 1. 2. and 4. conjugations
changes the final e of the active into i (amari, moneri, audiri). In the 3.
conjugation ἔνθ is changed into ἰ (tmere—leat).

2) The Present participle, in the 1. and 2. conjugations, adds ns to
the verb-stem, but ens in the 3. and 4. These participles are declined

like adjectives of common gender of one ending with I-stems (ξ 72).

OE'· The ablative of the present participle sometimes takes e instead of i, espe-
cially in the construction of the ablatives absolute (§ 178 soih).

3) The verbal adjective adds radus to the verb-stem in the 1. and 2.

conjugations, and andus in the 3. and 4.
&For the conjugation of the I-verbs of the 3. conjugation see §143 foll.

IV. CONJUGATION AND FORMATION OF THE PERFECT SYSTEM.

123. The perfect system is formed partly from the 1. person indica-
tive of the perfect tense, and partly from the first supine. These two
forms, together with the present infinitive and the 1. pers. of the present

indicative, are called the principa} forms of the verb.

Ι. conj. Αφηᾶνε, amo, αφηᾶυὶ, amatam.
ΙΙ. Conj. monere, moneo, moniti, monitum.
111. Conj. ἰὲῃένε, ἰέρο, lem. lectum.
IV. Conj. audire, audio, audivi, auaitum.

124. The perfect indicative in most verbs of the first and fourth
conjugations is formed by adding va· to the verb-stem (see ἓ 123) ; and the
supine, by adding tum.

The chief verbs deviating from this rule are the following :

I. Conj. Cubare, tolie down, cubo cubui cubitum
dare, to (live. do dedi (latum
domare, to subject, domo domui domitum
juvare, to help. js1vo juvi jutum
lavare, to was-h. lavo lavi lavatum (lautum)
sonare. to sound, sono sonui sonitum
stare, to stand. sto steti statum
tonare. to (leander, tono tonui tonitum
vetare, cosm-bid, veto vetui vetitum

IV. Conj. Aperne, to open, aperio aperui apertum
reperire. defend, reperio repperi repertum
sentire, lofeeb. sentio sensi sensum
vessire‚ to come, venio veni ventum

vincire, to bind, vincio vinxi vinctum.
&Dare is the only verb of the first coujugation with a short characteristic.
