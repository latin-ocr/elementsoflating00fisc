ject in number and person.

conspired—Quid impedit ,ἒ What hinders ‘2—Rex qaadebit ; The king will rejoice.

166. If the predicate is in the passive voice, the doer of the action is
added in the ablative after the preposition α (ab), corresponding to the

English by (Passive agent).

tibus transitur ; The river is crossed by the soldierS.

167. Every passive predicative phrase of this kind may be turned into
an active construction, without ehanging its sense. The passive subJ‘ect
becomes an active object in the accusative (ἓ 267), and the passive agent
becomes the active subject-nominative.

soldiers cross the river.

168. If the predicate is a copula-predicate (ἓ 164), the copula esse
agrees with the subject in number and person, and the predicate-adjec-

tive agrees with the subject in number, case, and gender.

maynafuit; The fleet was large—Classes masmae suerunt .· The fleets were large-No-

ally) in number. If it is a movable noun (ξ 26) it always agrees in

number and gender with the subject.

the subject in the same way as the predicate-adjectives and nouns con-
nected with the copula 6886.

ber, gender, and case, like a predicate—adjective (ἐ 132).
