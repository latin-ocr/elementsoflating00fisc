60 SYNTAX.

1 So. The predicate in the ablatives absolute (predicate-amative) agrees
with the subject-ablati ve in gender, number and case.

181. Ablatives absolute with predicate-ablatives in the participle of the
PERFECT PASSIVE, are usually rendered by the conjunction aster with the

(English) predicate in the pluperfect or past tense of the PASSIVE; or
by when with a pluperfect PASSIVE.

Caesare interfecto ; A f t e r Caesar had been killed (was killed).
Navi demerui ; A st e r the ship had been sunk (was sunk).
Laboribus perfectis · W h e n the labors had been accomplished.
Me praetermisso ,· W h e n I had been passed over.

182. Ablatives absolute with predicate-ablatives in the participle of
the perfect deponent, are rendered by after with an ACTIVE pluperfect 01·
past tense ; or by when with an ACTIVE pluperfect.

Caesare mortuo ,· After Caesar had died.
Emereicu reomago ,· When the army had returned.

Rem. 95. Notice, that the Latin language has no perfect participle of the active.
Hence, if an English active predicate with “ aster '' is to be expressed by Latin ablatives
absolute, we must first change the English construction passively, unless we can use a
dep011ent; as: CAEsAn, AFTER nn ΗΑΒ mmsnnn rm: wAn, RETURNED '1¹0 Rome. Here
the clause ‘⁴ after he had finished the war '' must be changed into the equivalent clause
‘⁶ after the war had been finished (by him) '³ : Caesar, bello perfecto, Romam redivit. Hence
neuter verbs, when there is no deponent available, cannot be used as predicate-abla-
tives. Such expressions as ‘⁶ After he had arrived'' must be rendered by temporai
clauses (ἐ 393), and not by ablatives absolute.

183. Ablatives absolute with predicates in a PRESENT participle are
rendered by while 01· when with an ACTIVE predicate of the present 01·
past tense. ’

Tarquinio reqnante ,· W h i l e (w h e n) Turquin reigned.
Me scribente ,· W hi le Ι was writing.
Nostris prosequentibus ,· W hi l e our troops were pursuing (them).

184. Copula-predicates (ξ 164) are used as predicate-ablatives by leav-
ing out the copula (which forms no participle), and placing the predicate-
noun, or predicate—adjective in the ABLATIVE, making it agree in gender
and number with the subject ablative.

185. Such predic-ates are literally rendered by while (when) with a
present or past tense, but generally by a freer imitation of the Latin
idiom.

Cicer-&ne comula ,· While (when) Cicero was consul, or “in Cicero’s consulship.”
Biggfficgg {Zffifficqlssiclpq'sulibus ,· When Caesar and Bibulus were consultu or ‘⁵ in Oaesar and

Coelo serem) ‚· When the sky is (was) clear ; or “ in clear weather.”
